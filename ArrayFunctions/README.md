# Explanation
## Main.java:
Here, an ArrayFunctions instance is created that calls the three important methods (evenOdd(), consecutiveDifference(), convert()).

## UserInput.java
Scanner class is used to get the input from the user. The user is supposed to enter 5 numbers that will be used as the input in the 3 methods.

## ArrayFunctions.java
### evenOdd():
After the user enters 5 numbers, the evenOdd method segregates the even and odd numbers and displays them as separate arrays.

### consecutiveDifference():
Finds out the difference between two consecutive elements in an array and return the index values of the elements which give the smallest difference.

### convert():
Converts an array into an arrayList and displays the output.
